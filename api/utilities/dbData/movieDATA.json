    "description": "Spike Lee's epic about the prominent resistance fighter Malcolm X. From his childhood when his pastor's father is killed by the Ku Klux Klan, through his youth when he becomes a petty gangster, to when he comes in contact with the Nation of Islam and their leader Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm soon finds that his distancing from racism and his role in the Nation of Islam have given him many enemies.",
